## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

Updated the data source from a class in the javascript server file and the data is now hosted in a MongoDB collection. Refactored code to request the data from MongoDB database instead of from my API's javascript. This way is much faster and allows for more flexibility when adding in new documents.

## Lessons Learned:

After working on this project for a few hours, I was nearly done and couldn't figure out why my requests weren't working. I double checked that everything had the correct spelling and syntax in my code about ten times and couldn't find the error. The next morning, I realized that my code was looking for 'name' instead of 'speciesName' in my database. Once I fixed that, everything worked perfectly! 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
